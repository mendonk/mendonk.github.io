I currently live in Pennsylvania, USA. I enjoy Runequest, cycling, computer games, and my wife Lizzie's humor and wisdom. 

Thanks to my friend [Ross Tyger](http://rosstyger.com) for the awesome portrait!

I am a technical writer now, but I was originally a musician. I host my home recordings on <a href="https://mendonkisslingsgreatesthits.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>.
