Thanks for stopping by. My name is Mendon. I am a freelance technical writer with four years of experience.
I got into freelancing because I value meeting new people, learning new things, and helping others succeed.

This site is still under construction. I will be adding work samples in the coming weeks, and I'd like to change the theme to something a little 
easier on the eyes.
