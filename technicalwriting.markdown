I am a technical writer by trade. I might blog about it a little here. I find technical writing is at an interesting place in the business cycle, and the trade itself is undergoing interesting changes. 

I have four years of experience writing web and print documentation, mostly for heavy equipment, electrical troubleshooting, and enterprise software. 

If you're looking for a technical writer to help your next project succeed, get in touch. I love meeting new people.
