I am a technical writer by trade. I might blog about it a little here. I find it's an interesting place in the business world, at an interesting place in time.   

I have four years of experience, mostly in heavy equipment, electrical troubleshooting, and enterprise software. 

If you're looking for a technical writer to help your next project succeed, get in touch. I love meeting new people.
