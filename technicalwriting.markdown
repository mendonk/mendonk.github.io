I am a technical writer by trade. I might blog about it a little here. I find technical writing is at an interesting place in the business cycle, and the trade itself is undergoing interesting changes. 

If you're looking for a technical writer to help your next project succeed, get in touch. I love meeting new people. 

Some recent projects I've worked on:

<a href="https://up9.com/docs/">UP9</a> Microservices Testing

<a href="https://docs.safegraph.com/docs">SafeGraph</a> Data Science Models

<a href="https://getmizu.io/">Mizu</a>, an API Traffic Viewer for Kubernetes
