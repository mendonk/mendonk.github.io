I am a technical writer by trade. I might blog about it a little here. I find technical writing is at an interesting place in the business process, and the trade itself is undergoing interesting changes. 

If you're looking for a technical writer to help your next project succeed, get in touch. I love meeting new people. 

Some recent projects I've worked on:

<a href="https://getmizu.io/">Mizu</a> API Traffic Viewer for Kubernetes
